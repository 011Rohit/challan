			The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) has been facilitating computerization of over 1100 Road Transport Offices<br> (RTOs) across the country. RTOs issue Registration Certificate (RC) & Driving License (DL) that are mandatory requirements <br>andare valid across the country, subject to certain provisions and permissions.<br>

With wide variations in state policies and manual/ system based procedures being followed across the country, it had become necessary to<br> same standards for these documents on a pan-India level to ensure interoperability, correctness and timely availability of information.<br> SCOSTA committee setup for this purpose had recommended a uniform standardized software across the country. The Ministry thus entrusted<br>National Informatics Centre (NIC) with the task of standardizing & deploying two softwares - VAHAN for Vehicle Registration and SARATHI for<br> Driving Licenses and of compiling the data with respect to Vehicle Registration and Driving Licenses of all the states in State<br> Register and National Register.The applications VAHAN & SARATHI were conceptualized to capture the functionalities as mandated by Central <br>Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 as well as State motor vehicle Rules with customization in the core product to suit the requirements of 36<br> States and UTs.
